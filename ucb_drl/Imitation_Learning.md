##### Terminology
In supervised learning model for classification task can be represented as \pi_{\theta}(a|o). In the representation \pi is the conditional probability distribution over 'a', the discrete random variable given the input 'o'. The subscript denotes that the distribution is parameterised by '\theta'.
In sequential decision making task we represent the timestep using 't'.
